# User Feedback Needs 

## Three things to get user feedback on: 

### 1. User satisfaction with our overall current product
> App as a whole is understandable, aesthetic, sensible, etc. 
* Please go through app and give overall satisfaction with the entirety of it.
* ***Note:*** the homepage has not been updated much since MVP, but we are also open to feedback of what users would want to appear in homepage. We do not like the current ideas we have as placeholders in the homepage so ideas are welcome!! 

### 2. User Satisfaction with Searching Books and Adding/Moving Books to Shelves
> User is able to search for a book, add book to shelf, and easily switch the shelf or delete from shelf.
* Test the functionality of search for a book in the search bar, clicking on the book and being taken to that book's page.
* From there you can favorite the book and/or add it to a shelf (Currently Reading, etc...)
* Then user navigate to **My Shelf** page and see the books in their respective shelves.
* In the **My Shelf** page, user can also drag books between the progress shelves (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Finished Reading) for easy updates.
* In **My Shelf** page user can select edit and easily remove books. 


### 3. User Satisfaction with For you page
> User must have at least one book added to Finished Reading (FR) shelf for the Read Next suggestions to populate.
Can test with the following: 
* Adding one book to FR should suggest books
* Adding more books to FR should suggest more tailored books
* Adding books of different genres to FR
* Adding books of same genre to FR
