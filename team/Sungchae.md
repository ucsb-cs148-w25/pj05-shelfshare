* Hello, my name is Sungchae and I am a fourth-year computer science major. I took CS154 last year that focused on the project called gaucho-rideshare which is a legacy web app project for that class. In the class, I gained experience in React Native and Javascript. Those were the main tools for building both the frontend and backend. 
* I would like to build an AI group assigner that could gather people with the same interest and need based on conversation with users.
