For this project, I worked mainly on the search bar, API integration and usage, navigation, the homepage challenge, and graphs for displaying user activity. In the beginning of the project, I worked on creating the placeholder page for the MyShelf page and implementing an experimental UI for us to use. Then I took on the issue of linking the backend to the searchbar and providing search functionality. I used the open library public API for this. Then to link the unique book to the book placeholder page, I retrieved th relevant information to display unique title, description, and star rating for the book clicked on from search and created a unique [bookId]/page.tsx page to navigate successfully. I did some additional cleaning of the search functionality, clearing the text in the search bar when the user selects a book to keep it clean. Then I switched focus to the homepage and added the Yearly Reading challenge frontend and backend implementation for the user to see how far they have gotten in the year for what they read. After some feedback I added warning for negative book goals so interacting with the reading goal was more user friendly and easy to use. Then I made an experiment to try using the Google Books API for the backend of the search bar. I got it working and we talked about it as a group. We decided to keep the Open Library implementation because it was a little late in the quarter, and another group member that would have had to make major changes to their already completed implementations would not have had enough time to complete with their other issues. So we abandoned that issue. Then I added graphs to display user reading activity on the Profile page. For this I made a pie chart to display genre distribution of the books in the user's Currently Reading shelf and their Finished Reading shelf. And I made 4 line charts to display reading activity over time. One chart for the monthly activity and one for the weekly activity for the Currently Reading. And the same for the Finished Reading shelves to have a weekly and monthly charts. I also did the frontend of these charts and added tabs so the user can easily navigate on the Profile page to view. Then after the other group's feedback, I added implementation to the search bar to populate 3 pages in the search results drop down, and I added implementation to enable user to search by either book Title, or book Author. I also cleaned up book descriptions on the book page to get rid of html code. All along the way I reviewed many of my group's PRs, resolved quite a few merge conflicts, and authored over 20 commits.

In this project, some of my contributions were developing the UI for the product, implementing the functionality and design for the browse page, and implementing the design for the home page. In the first weeks, I took all the group's ideas for our product and created a hand-drawn design with all the main features and pages, from the navigation bar structure and general page contents/designs to the color schemes. As a group, we then discussed the features we wanted to keep and the changes we wanted to make to the layout, design, functionality, and presentation. After, I created the Figma design for the main pages, including the login, home, browse, and My Shelf page, which served as a template for the pages going forward. I then created the frontend templates for the home and browse pages to populate later on. After that, I mainly worked on implementing the backend functionality for the browse page. I originally started by creating the ability to query the API for the book results based on the selected genre, showing around 20 books, with each book’s title, author, year published, and rating, presented in a card format. Then I added the Filter Box to filter books by rating and year published as well as the ability to see Trending books as well, which can be seen by selecting the “Popular” tag. After my team’s feedback, I also made UI changes to fix the sizing to be consistent across all devices. Coming into this course, I wasn’t very familiar with Git, so early on, I did not commit as I developed. I also worked on linking the For You page recommendations to their respective book page, as well as implementing the Reading Now shelf on the home page. Moving forward, I will be implementing a Search By Author feature on the browse page as well. I also worked on the unit testing lab and the design document.

For this project, I took on a lot of tasks ranging from Navigation, to UI, to storing items in Firebase. Navigation issues involved adjusting the styling, adding all pages to the Navbar to be directed correct, and adding dropdowns as needed. I also added fun styling features such as when hovering over a tab it changes color. Additionally, when a user is on a tab, this is reflected in the Navbar via a box over that page name. I also made sure that the Navigation bar did not end up on the Login page so that people could not bypass logging in. Before we switched to being a book only platform, I also had implemented a dropdown that would switch the navigation links to their respective media types for each page. This was later removed so that the product could be a fully fleshed out with just the books. I also created the For You page which utilizes Geminai to create personalized recommendations based on what respective users have finished reading. These recommendations are things that they may like for one shelf and then another shelf recommends things they can branch out to if they are looking for something completely different. This page also has the top 10 books of the year, 8 of which are from the New Yor Times (two of them were not in our book api, so I added two popular books at the end). This page also collects information from the user's friends favorites shelf and displays them as recommendations based on what they are reading. The books that will appear first here are ones that multiple friends have in their favorites. This distinction is made by have a count of how many friends have this in their favorites in the top right hand corner. Additionally, I adjusted the UI in the My Shelf as well as For You pages to look more like books, have better scrolling, and to include shadows if there are books that the user is not currently looking at but could see upon scrolling. This also included making the books rectangular to be more "book shaped" instead of like widgets. I also adjusted the padding around the books to make them less crowded. Finally, I added the Book Club feature which will include a discussion forum, chapter deadlines, books, and friends. If the user has created the club, they will also have the ability to delete it. This feature is still a work in progress, but should be finished for the final presentations. It has a few things happening behind the scenes in the firebase to store information which was interesting to take on. Also, I will be making some minor updates to the Timeline page's UI. I also had the opportunity to review many PRs as well as handle some merge conflicts on the way. I also helped Niyati with app deployment and got to act as Scrum Master during this project.

In our team project, I contributed by implementing frontend/backend features and enhancing user experience. First, I implemented the book page interface, including the functionality for users to start a review. I also worked on the My Shelf feature, which allows users to add books from the book page to their desired shelf categories. Additionally, I introduced a favorite option, enabling users to favorite books using a heart icon on the book page. To improve shelf management, I implemented a drag-and-drop feature for organizing books, an edit shelf option, and a custom shelf feature for personalized categorization. Moving forward, I worked on enhancing the profile page UI and functionality, introducing a feature that allows users to view their friends' full profiles and see their favorite shelf. Lastly, I added a friend activity feed on the book page, where users can view their friends' interactions with books, such as reviews and favorites.
