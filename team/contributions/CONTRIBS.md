For this project, I took on a lot of tasks ranging from Navigation, to UI, to storing items in Firebase. Navigation issues involved adjusting the styling, adding all pages to the Navbar to be directed correct, and adding dropdowns as needed. I also added fun styling features such as when hovering over a tab it changes color. Additionally, when a user is on a tab, this is reflected in the Navbar via a box over that page name. I also made sure that the Navigation bar did not end up on the Login page so that people could not bypass logging in. Before we switched to being a book only platform, I also had implemented a dropdown that would switch the navigation links to their respective media types for each page. This was later removed so that the product could be a fully fleshed out with just the books. I also created the For You page which utilizes Geminai to create personalized recommendations based on what respective users have finished reading. These recommendations are things that they may like for one shelf and then another shelf recommends things they can branch out to if they are looking for something completely different. This page also has the top 10 books of the year, 8 of which are from the New Yor Times (two of them were not in our book api, so I added two popular books at the end). This page also collects information from the user's friends favorites shelf and displays them as recommendations based on what they are reading. The books that will appear first here are ones that multiple friends have in their favorites. This distinction is made by have a count of how many friends have this in their favorites in the top right hand corner. Additionally, I adjusted the UI in the My Shelf as well as For You pages to look more like books, have better scrolling, and to include shadows if there are books that the user is not currently looking at but could see upon scrolling. This also included making the books rectangular to be more "book shaped" instead of like widgets. I also adjusted the padding around the books to make them less crowded. Finally, I added the Book Club feature which will include a discussion forum, chapter deadlines, books, and friends. If the user has created the club, they will also have the ability to delete it. This feature is still a work in progress, but should be finished for the final presentations. It has a few things happening behind the scenes in the firebase to store information which was interesting to take on. Also, I will be making some minor updates to the Timeline page's UI. I also had the opportunity to review many PRs as well as handle some merge conflicts on the way. I also helped Niyati with app deployment and got to act as Scrum Master during this project.

In our team project, I contributed by implementing frontend/backend features and enhancing user experience. First, I implemented the book page interface, including the functionality for users to start a review. I also worked on the My Shelf feature, which allows users to add books from the book page to their desired shelf categories. Additionally, I introduced a favorite option, enabling users to favorite books using a heart icon on the book page. To improve shelf management, I implemented a drag-and-drop feature for organizing books, an edit shelf option, and a custom shelf feature for personalized categorization. Moving forward, I worked on enhancing the profile page UI and functionality, introducing a feature that allows users to view their friends' full profiles and see their favorite shelf. Lastly, I added a friend activity feed on the book page, where users can view their friends' interactions with books, such as reviews and favorites.
