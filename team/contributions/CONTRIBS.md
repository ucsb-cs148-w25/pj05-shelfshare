For this project, I worked on implementing Google OAuth for user authentication and ensuring that signed-in users were properly populated in the database to track and store their information. This allowed for easy login and user management across the web app. I also developed the friend request system that handles both the frontend and backend functionality for sending, accepting, and removing friend requests. I implemented the frontend for the Friends page which allows users to search through the list of registered users and profile names. On the backend, I worked on structuring the database to support friend connections. I spent time learning how to understand Firebase and its security rules to ensure proper access control and data protection. This involved configuring Firestore rules to prevent unauthorized access to user data and managing permissions for friend-related actions. Throughout the project, I actively reviewed PRs and resolved merge conflicts. I also assisted in testing different edge cases within the friend request system to prevent errors and improve reliability. In collaboration with Charlene, I contributed to adding a very early version of the navigation bar on the homepage.

For this project, I worked mainly on the search bar, API integration and usage, navigation, the homepage challenge, and graphs for displaying user activity. In the beginning of the project, I worked on creating the placeholder page for the MyShelf page and implementing an experimental UI for us to use. Then I took on the issue of linking the backend to the searchbar and providing search functionality. I used the open library public API for this. Then to link the unique book to the book placeholder page, I retrieved th relevant information to display unique title, description, and star rating for the book clicked on from search and created a unique [bookId]/page.tsx page to navigate successfully. I did some additional cleaning of the search functionality, clearing the text in the search bar when the user selects a book to keep it clean. Then I switched focus to the homepage and added the Yearly Reading challenge frontend and backend implementation for the user to see how far they have gotten in the year for what they read. After some feedback I added warning for negative book goals so interacting with the reading goal was more user friendly and easy to use. Then I made an experiment to try using the Google Books API for the backend of the search bar. I got it working and we talked about it as a group. We decided to keep the Open Library implementation because it was a little late in the quarter, and another group member that would have had to make major changes to their already completed implementations would not have had enough time to complete with their other issues. So we abandoned that issue. Then I added graphs to display user reading activity on the Profile page. For this I made a pie chart to display genre distribution of the books in the user's Currently Reading shelf and their Finished Reading shelf. And I made 4 line charts to display reading activity over time. One chart for the monthly activity and one for the weekly activity for the Currently Reading. And the same for the Finished Reading shelves to have a weekly and monthly charts. I also did the frontend of these charts and added tabs so the user can easily navigate on the Profile page to view. Then after the other group's feedback, I added implementation to the search bar to populate 3 pages in the search results drop down, and I added implementation to enable user to search by either book Title, or book Author. I also cleaned up book descriptions on the book page to get rid of html code. All along the way I reviewed many of my group's PRs and resolved quite a few merge conflicts.

For this project, I made some contribution to the features in Homepage, Friend's page, and Profile page. In the beginning of the project, I made figma design for login and profile page. Then, I started working on the frondend and backend of the profile page. The backend of the profile page mostly involved firebase to store user's information. After getting some feedbacks, I enabled user to see some of the other users' profile information in the friends page by adding the button fucntionality to usernames that manages the visibility of those information. During the middle phase of the development, I worked on local library finder functionality in homepage. I worekd on frontend and backend for this feature. The backend of this feature involves using two APIs that involved the job of converting the zipcode to the coordinates in a map, searching libraries within 20km, leasting top 5 closest libraries, and displaying the zipcode's location as well as those libraries within a map. In the beginning, I planned to just list the names of the local libraries rather than the whole map. However, the team members gave me feedback to the need of feature visuality so, I added the visual map feature at the end. Also, for the simplicity of the UI in the homepage, I added the visiblity management functionality of the local library map. Besides my individual work, I had an opportunity to work as a Retro leader during the project. Also, I reviewed many PRs and merged some of them.

In this project, some of my contributions were developing the UI for the product, implementing the functionality and design for the browse page, and implementing the design for the home page. In the first weeks, I took all the group's ideas for our product and created a hand-drawn design with all the main features and pages, from the navigation bar structure and general page contents/designs to the color schemes. As a group, we then discussed the features we wanted to keep and the changes we wanted to make to the layout, design, functionality, and presentation. After, I created the Figma design for the main pages, including the login, home, browse, and My Shelf page, which served as a template for the pages going forward. I then created the frontend templates for the home and browse pages to populate later on. After that, I mainly worked on implementing the backend functionality for the browse page. I originally started by creating the ability to query the API for the book results based on the selected genre, showing around 20 books, with each book’s title, author, year published, and rating, presented in a card format. Then I added the Filter Box to filter books by rating and year published as well as the ability to see Trending books as well, which can be seen by selecting the “Popular” tag. After my team’s feedback, I also made UI changes to fix the sizing to be consistent across all devices. Coming into this course, I wasn’t very familiar with Git, so early on, I did not commit as I developed. I also worked on linking the For You page recommendations to their respective book page, as well as implementing the Reading Now shelf on the home page. Moving forward, I will be implementing a Search By Author feature on the browse page as well. I also worked on the unit testing lab and the design document.


# Niyati
For this project, I was responsible for both frontend and backend development of the timeline feature. I implemented a timeline backend to efficiently store and retrieve user activity and designed the frontend interface to display this activity in an engaging and intuitive way. I also set up Firebase as the project's backend infrastructure, configuring authentication, database storage, and security rules to ensure user data protection. Additionally, I developed the review system, allowing users to add reviews to books. Each review is associated with the user’s name, enhancing personalization and engagement within the app. To improve user interaction, I implemented a feature on the timeline page that allows users to click on a notification and be redirected to the specific review their friend left. This makes it easier for users to engage with their friends' activity and discover new books. Beyond the review system, I worked on integrating Spotify to generate playlists based on book themes and vibes. I also developed the functionality for users to add friends and interact with them on the homepage. To maintain project stability, I have been actively deploying the app and verifying that all features work correctly after each deployment. This includes troubleshooting issues, ensuring a seamless user experience, and addressing any necessary fixes along the way.

For this project, I took on a lot of tasks ranging from Navigation, to UI, to storing items in Firebase. Navigation issues involved adjusting the styling, adding all pages to the Navbar to be directed correct, and adding dropdowns as needed. I also added fun styling features such as when hovering over a tab it changes color. Additionally, when a user is on a tab, this is reflected in the Navbar via a box over that page name. I also made sure that the Navigation bar did not end up on the Login page so that people could not bypass logging in. Before we switched to being a book only platform, I also had implemented a dropdown that would switch the navigation links to their respective media types for each page. This was later removed so that the product could be a fully fleshed out with just the books. I also created the For You page which utilizes Geminai to create personalized recommendations based on what respective users have finished reading. These recommendations are things that they may like for one shelf and then another shelf recommends things they can branch out to if they are looking for something completely different. This page also has the top 10 books of the year, 8 of which are from the New Yor Times (two of them were not in our book api, so I added two popular books at the end). This page also collects information from the user's friends favorites shelf and displays them as recommendations based on what they are reading. The books that will appear first here are ones that multiple friends have in their favorites. This distinction is made by have a count of how many friends have this in their favorites in the top right hand corner. Additionally, I adjusted the UI in the My Shelf as well as For You pages to look more like books, have better scrolling, and to include shadows if there are books that the user is not currently looking at but could see upon scrolling. This also included making the books rectangular to be more "book shaped" instead of like widgets. I also adjusted the padding around the books to make them less crowded. Finally, I added the Book Club feature which will include a discussion forum, chapter deadlines, books, and friends. If the user has created the club, they will also have the ability to delete it. This feature is still a work in progress, but should be finished for the final presentations. It has a few things happening behind the scenes in the firebase to store information which was interesting to take on. Also, I will be making some minor updates to the Timeline page's UI. I also had the opportunity to review many PRs as well as handle some merge conflicts on the way. I also helped Niyati with app deployment and got to act as Scrum Master during this project.

In our team project, I contributed by implementing both frontend and backend features while also enhancing the overall user experience. My issues mostly focused on improving key functionalities that help users interact with books, organize their personal collections, and engage with their friends on the platform. First, I worked on the book page interface, made sure that users could easily navigate and search book and go to the specific book which they are searching. Within the BookPages, I also implemented the functionality for users to start a review directly from the book page, which allows them to share their thoughts and ratings. I also developed the "My Shelf" feature, which lets users add books from the book page to their desired shelf categories. This feature helps users keep track of their reading progress and organize books based on their preferences, such as “Currently Reading,” “Completed,” “Dropped” or “Want to Read.” The dropdown menu is located in BookPage for users to add their books to their shelves. To make book organization even more user-friendly, I introduced several improvements to the shelf management system. I implemented a drag-and-drop feature that enables users to seamlessly move books between shelves, making it easier to rearrange their collections. Additionally, I added an edit shelf option, allowing users to rename or delete shelves as needed. Another major enhancement was the custom shelf feature, which lets users create personalized categories beyond the default ones, giving them more control over how they organize their books, I also made changes to firebase, so the new custom bookshelf appears on the dropdown on BookPage. Beyond shelf management, I also introduced a favorite option, allowing users to mark books they love using a heart icon on the book page. Moving forward, I contributed to improving the profile page UI and functionality. I made feature that user could make tags for their favorite genres. I also worked on a feature that allows users to view their friends' full profiles, which includes seeing their favorite shelf. Lastly, I implemented a friend activity feed on the book page. This feature displays interactions from friends, such as when they add books to their shelves, leave reviews, or mark books as favorites. It creates a more engaging and dynamic experience by allowing users to stay updated on what their friends are reading and enjoying.
