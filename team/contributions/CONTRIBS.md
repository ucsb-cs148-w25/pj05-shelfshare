In our team project, I contributed by implementing frontend/backend features and enhancing user experience. First, I implemented the book page interface, including the functionality for users to start a review. I also worked on the My Shelf feature, which allows users to add books from the book page to their desired shelf categories. Additionally, I introduced a favorite option, enabling users to favorite books using a heart icon on the book page. To improve shelf management, I implemented a drag-and-drop feature for organizing books, an edit shelf option, and a custom shelf feature for personalized categorization. Moving forward, I worked on enhancing the profile page UI and functionality, introducing a feature that allows users to view their friends' full profiles and see their favorite shelf. Lastly, I added a friend activity feed on the book page, where users can view their friends' interactions with books, such as reviews and favorites.
