# Team Introductions

**Team Member: Hannah Shakouri**  

Hi, my name is Hannah, I'm a fourth-year Computer Science major. Last winter, I took CS185, where I learned about UX/UI design and Figma, and in CS156 last spring, I worked on the GauchoRide web app, gain experience with React Native and JavaScript on both the backend and frontend. Last quarter in CS184, I worked on a room layout planner app where I contributed to the UI design and functionality. I collaborated on designing the initial user interface in Figma, implemented features like scrollable furniture list.

# Poject ideas:

Here are some project ideas Iâ€™m passionate about:
- Similar what we are going to do with ShelfShare, a social platform where users can post their favorite books, write reviews, rate them, create virtual bookshelves, join book clubs, and discuss in forums.
- A simple to-do list web app for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, setting deadlines, and marking them as complete.
- An app where users vote on a list of movies to decide what to watch, with a countdown to the chosen movie night.
- An app designed for students to organize study schedules, track subjects, and set reminders for exams and assignments.
