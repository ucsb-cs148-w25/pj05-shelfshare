# Team Introductions 

**Team Member: Charlene Patenaude**

Hi, I am a fourth year Computer Science and Communication double major with a double minor in Statistics and Applied Psychology. Last quarter I worked on a blueprint mobile app in CS 184 and last year I worked on happycows in CS 156. This is my third CS project class, although I have never created a webapp. 

# Project Ideas: 

- I am interested in doing the book/media shelf/share project that was mentioned in previous conversations. 
- Another idea is to create a character that you get to feed and take on adventures (this was what I submitted for our first assignment). 
- The team was originally created around a rideshare idea and I like that idea, but am not sure how conducive a webapp would be for it (feels like a mobile project).
