# AI CODING 
List the AI tool you utilized, the outcomes you produced, and, importantly, reflections on: 
* how useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward
* what steps you needed to (or couldn’t) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use


## Bella
* AI tool used: DeepSeek
* Outcomes: worked on prototypes for adding animations to the For You page when hovering over a book. I asked for a page turning animation and went back and forth with DeepSeek for a while, but I do not really like the animations it made for page turning and don't think they look anything like page turning. But I liked the outcome prototype for exploding the book you are hovering on in the row. I included not hovering and hovering screenshots to get the idea.

#### Reflection: 
* Deepseek was very helpful for starting the code and making adjustments when you give it feedback. It was able to make many edits and work with me. It could be useful for our coding effort going forward to give it basic UI implementation as it seems to get that correct the most. Sometimes though, after asking a few questions it stops answering your question and tells you to ask again later. I think it is pretty useful to experiment with different UI features and animations. 
* I needed to look over the code I was given and look for anything that seemed out of place. Also I had to heavily test the code locally and ensure there were no edge cases the AI waas not covering. I was able to simply promt the AI to give understandable explanation of the output. To ensure it is fair use, I ensure the output is not far off from the code I give the AI to prevent any complete copying. 

## Niyati
* AI tool used: ChatGPT
* Outcomes: worked on the frotend portion of the timeline page. I gave chatgpt the figma that we created and asked it to create a page like the figma. It created something similar to the page but not exactly the same as the Figma.

#### Reflection:
* ChatGPT was somewhat helpful. Although it took a lot of refining to get the page to look like the Figma page. It got the colors incorrect the first time and the UI didn't look great. It got the functionality of the page correctly but in terms of UI I thought it could have done better. I had to ask ChatGPT multiple times to fix the UI and where I wanted specific boxes. At the end, the page did not exactly the same as the figma but it looked similar enough.

## Hannah
* AI tool used: Claude
* Outcomes: I used Claude to help implement a dynamic bookshelf feature for our reading tracking application. The feature allows users to organize their books into different shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Finished Reading) and mark books as favorites. Claude helped me set up Firebase integration for storing the data and guided me through fixing various TypeScript errors. The end result is a working shelf system where users can easily categorize their books and see them displayed in an organized way, with real time updates when books are added or moved between shelves.

#### Reflection:
Working with Claude on this feature was both helpful and educational. While the AI was great at suggesting solutions and fixing TypeScript errors, I learned it's important to be specific with questions and break down problems into smaller parts. Sometimes we had to go through multiple iterations to get the types right, especially with Firebase integration. The most valuable aspect was how Claude explained each solution, helping me understand not just what to do but why certain approaches were better than others. This experience showed me that AI can be a powerful tool for development, but it works best when used as a guide rather than just a solution provider.
