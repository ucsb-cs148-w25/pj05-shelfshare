# AI CODING 
List the AI tool you utilized, the outcomes you produced, and, importantly, reflections on: 
* how useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward
* what steps you needed to (or couldn’t) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use


## Bella
* AI tool used: DeepSeek
* Outcomes: worked on prototypes for adding animations to the For You page when hovering over a book. I asked for a page turning animation and went back and forth with DeepSeek for a while, but I do not really like the animations it made for page turning and don't think they really look like pageturning.

#### Reflection: 
* Deepseek was very helpful for starting the code and making adjustments when you give it feedback. It was able to make many edits and work with me. It could be useful for our coding effort going forward to give it basic UI implementation as it seems to get that correct the most.
* I needed to look over the code I was given and look for anything that seemed out of place. Also I had to heavily test the code locally and ensure there were no edge cases the AI waas not covering. I was able to simply promt the AI to give understandable explanation of the output. To ensure it is fair use, I ensure the output is not far off from the code I give the AI to prevent any complete copying.
