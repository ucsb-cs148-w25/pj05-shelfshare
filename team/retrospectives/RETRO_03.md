## Retro Outcomes

Our team used the start, stop, and continue method for reflecting on how the past couple of weeks have been progressing. 

Report:
* Successes
  - Communicating clearly about issues and challenges that team members are running into.
  - Organizing upcoming issues, setting soft and hard deadlines, and everyone completing their action items on time.
  - Reviewing, approving, and merging PRs during class time.
* A Goal: The team wants to begin finalizing all remaining issues necessary to complete before the upcoming code freeze. We also want to work on our current issues as soon as possible and be quick about approving PRs.
* A Commitment: To maximize productivity as we near the code freeze and launch date, our team is committed to creating, approving, and merging PRs as soon as we see them, especially if it is outside class time. This will allow us to move quicker toward our final product in an organized manner.
