## Action item

Goal: Approve and merge PRs on time, making sure they are merged after at least two reviews.
Change: Track the number of PRs that are still open and not merged after receiving two reviews.
Measurement: If the number of unmerged PRs is low, it indicates progress toward achieving the goal. If it remains high, further adjustments may be needed.

* Stop

  - Leaving PRs unmerged after approval
    
* Continue
  - Making a fake deadline for each task
  - Staying active on slack
  - Approving & merging prs outside of class time


## Retro Assessment
- Our team discussed about the start, stop continue features that focused mainly on pr management and deployment features.
- A brief assessment went well. It allowed whole groups to knowledge the importance of deployment, which could decrease merge conflict. 
- I would encourage the next retro leader to make everyone feel more involved. 


## Retro Records
This retro marks the beginning of our focus on improving PR approvals and timely merges. Future retrospectives will assess progress, refine our approach, and identify additional areas for improvement.
