# Team Introductions

**Team Member: Towela Phiri**


Hello! I am a fourth year Computer Science major with research interests in ethical AI, computer vision for social change, and computer networking. I have taken CS156 where I gained experience working with Javascript and ReactNative. I also learned the basics of SCRUM and agile methods.


# Project Ideas:


- I am interested in doing the book shelf and media sharing project.
- I am particularly interested in integrating a music/playlist suggestion system based on a user's book preferences using the Spotify API.
- Another idea is to create an app that serves as a central access point containting resources for small business owners in a particular city and as a resource to connect customers to these businesses.
