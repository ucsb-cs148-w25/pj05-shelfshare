Our team is developing ShelfShare, which is a social platform for media enthusiasts that brings together books, movies, and albums in one place. ShelfShare allows users to rate and review their favorite media, helping them connect with a community of individuals who share their interests. Alongside writing reviews, users can explore personalized recommendations tailored to their interests, making it easier to discover their next favorite book, movie, or album. With ShelfShare, finding and sharing media becomes an engaging and meaningful experience.

## Tech Stack
We’re using a modern tech stack to build our web app, focusing on simplicity, performance, and a great user experience. Our frontend is built with React and Next.js. On the backend, we’re using Firebase for authentication, real-time database management, and serverless functions. For styling, we chose Tailwind CSS, which makes it easy to create a clean, consistent, and responsive design. This stack helps us work efficiently while delivering a high-quality web app.
