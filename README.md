## Tech Stack
We’re using a modern tech stack to build our web app, focusing on simplicity, performance, and a great user experience. Our frontend is built with React and Next.js. On the backend, we’re using Firebase for authentication, real-time database management, and serverless functions. For styling, we chose Tailwind CSS, which makes it easy to create a clean, consistent, and responsive design. This stack helps us work efficiently while delivering a high-quality web app.
